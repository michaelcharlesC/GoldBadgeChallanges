# GoldBadgeChallanges
Gold Badge Challenges for Eleven Fifty Academy project.

The goal was to build a minimum of three Console Applications (following the repository pattern we've used in class as well as including Unit Tests for the each repositories) for a minimum of three of the Gold Badge Console Application Challenge Prompts. 

Requirements:
A minimum of three (3) Console Applications built based on prompts linked above
All applications will be built in one single solution
Each project's architecture should include an assembly each for the ProgramUI, Repository, and Unit Tests
A Unit Test assembly for each challenge with test coverage for all repository functionality
Tests for the UI (Console Application) are not required but are highly encouraged
Assemblies should have a consistent naming convention that helps identify related groups
Examples:
ChallengeOne.Console, ChallengeOne.Repository, etc
Badges.Console, Badges.Repository, etc.
No extra white space, proper naming convention of variables and classes
A README attached to the project that documents the project
Regular use of git while working through the project

 I have completed five challanges :
 
Challange 1 - Komodo Cafe    
Challange 2 - Badges    
Challange 3 - Claims   
challange 4 - Company Outings   
Challange 5 - Greetings     

These can be found in my Git repos.
