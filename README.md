# GoldBadgeChallanges
Gold Badge Challenges for class

 I have completed 5 challanges where I included Console app , Repository , and Unit test for each method from the repo.     
 Consoles app should work with no error and all unit tests should pass 100% .   
 
 
Challange 1 - Komodo Cafe    
Challange 2 - Badges    
Challange 3 - Claims   
challange 4 - Company Outings   
Challange 5 - Greetings     

When uploading the challanges to GitHub, I noticed that the folder "TestResults" was not uploaded to git because this is an "hidden" file. 
Please let me know if this affected the unit test of each program and I will try to upload this as well.   

Thank you, I hope you have fun with my litle programs.
