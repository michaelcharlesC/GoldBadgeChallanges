# GoldBadgeChallanges
Gold Badge Challenges for class

 I have completed 5 challanges where I included Console app , Repository , and Unit test for each method from the repo. 
 Consoles app should work with no error and all unit tests should pass 100% .
 
Challange 1 - Komodo Cafe 
Challange 2 - Badges
Challange 3 - Claims
challange 4 - Company Outings
Challange 5 - Greetings 

When uploading the challanges to GitHub, I noticed that the folder "TestResults" was not uploaded to git. For some reason, it does not allow me to upload that. 
Please let me know if this affected the unit test of each program and I will try again to upload this.

Thank you, I hope you have fun with my litle programs.
